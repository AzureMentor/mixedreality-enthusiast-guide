# Using SteamVR with Windows Mixed Reality

Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR allows users to run SteamVR experiences on Windows Mixed Reality immersive headsets. After installing the Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR, users can launch their favorite SteamVR applications from their desktop or Steam library and play them directly on their Windows headset.

To get started follow the [SteamVR setup instructions for Windows Mixed Reality](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4053622/windows-10-play-steamvr-games-in-windows-mixed-reality).

## Getting the most out of SteamVR on Windows Mixed Reality

We will be releasing frequent updates to improve the performance, reliability, and overall experience of using SteamVR on Windows Mixed Reality immersive headsets. To stay up to date with the latest improvements:
* Check for Windows updates regularly
* Switch to the SteamVR beta if you want to try out fixes before they're released to a broader audience
  1. In Steam - use the drop down under your Library to filter to Tools and then locate SteamVR in the list
  2. Open SteamVR properties - right click SteamVR in the same Tools page and open the Properties dialog.![Install SteamVR from the tools section of your Steam Library](images/steamvr-install.png)
  3. Join the SteamVR Beta - click the Betas tab and opt into SteamVR Beta Update by selecting it from the drop down. **Note:** The beta access code field should be left blank and you can just hit close to confirm.![Switch to the SteamVR beta in the properties dialog for SteamVR](images/steamvr-beta.png)
  
## Changing the resolution

You can adjust the "Supersampling" slider in the SteamVR -> Settings -> Developer window at any time if you'd like to play games at a higher resolution. Note that when using a higher "Supersampling" multiplier you can expect the game to put more strain on your PC. If you increase the multiplier and see degraded performance readjust this slider to the default level and restart the game to ensure that the change takes effect.![Adjust Supersampling](images/RenderTarget.jpg)

## Using multiple headsets

If you're a VR enthusiast you might regularly use more than one VR headset on the same PC. If that's the case note that when a Windows Mixed Reality headset is plugged in, SteamVR games will always launch to the Windows Mixed Reality headset. If you'd like to launch SteamVR games on another headset make sure to first unplug the Windows Mixed Reality headset before continuing. 

## Enabling controller thumbstick turning in any SteamVR application

**Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR** has an experimental feature to enable the use of a controller thumbstick for artificial turns in any StreamVR application.  

To enable thumbstick turning:
1. Edit "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\MixedRealityVRDriver\resources\settings\default.vrsettings"
    * Path will be different if **Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR** was installed to a different library
2. Change either `thumbstickTurnLeftEnabled` or `thumbstickTurnRightEnabled` to `true`
3. Select **stutter turn** or **smooth turn** as shown in the examples below

**Example 1: Enabling stutter turn**

    "driver_Holographic_Experimental" : {
        "thumbstickTurnLeftEnabled" : false,
        "thumbstickTurnRightEnabled" : true,

        // Some people may experience increased discomfort such as nausea, motion sickness, dizziness,
        // disorientation, headache, fatigue, or eye strain when using “smooth turns” in Windows Mixed Reality.
        "thumbstickTurnSmooth" : false
    }
    
**Example 2: Enabling smooth turn**

    "driver_Holographic_Experimental" : {
        "thumbstickTurnLeftEnabled" : false,
        "thumbstickTurnRightEnabled" : true,

        // Some people may experience increased discomfort such as nausea, motion sickness, dizziness,
        // disorientation, headache, fatigue, or eye strain when using “smooth turns” in Windows Mixed Reality.
        "thumbstickTurnSmooth" : true
    }
