# Plug in your headset

## Connect your headset to your PC's USB 3.0 port

Identify the USB 3.0 port on your computer and plug in the USB cable. USB 3.0 ports have SS (Super Speed) written next to them. They are often (but not always) colored blue.

If you do not have enough open USB ports on your PC, you can use an [AC-powered external USB 3.0 hub](recommended-adapters-for-windows-mixed-reality-capable-pcs.md#using-external-usb-30-hubs-with-windows-mixed-reality-headsets).

## Connect your headset to your PC's HDMI out port

Identify the **HDMI out** port on your computer and plug in the headset's HDMI cable. Make sure you are **not** plugging into the HDMI in port!

## Connect headphones to your headset

Unless you purchased a Samsung HMD Odyssey headset (which has integrated AKG headphones and an integrated dual-array microphone), you will need to connect headphones (preferably with an inline microphone) that can plug into your headset's 3.5mm audio jack.

## Common issues
* Make sure to plug in the USB 3.0 cable **before** plugging in the HDMI cable.
* If you are using a Bluetooth adapter, do not plug in your headset's USB cable next to that dongle as the resulting radio interference may negatively impact Bluetooth performance.

## My PC doesn't have an HDMI port; I may need an adapter
